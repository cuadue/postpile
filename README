A doodle inspired by RPGs and hexagonal games. The controls are:

                  forward

                     W
    forward-left  Q     E  forward-right
       back-left  A     D  back-right
                     S

                  backward

    F zooms in
    V zooms out
    T pitches up
    G pitches down

    F1 Toggles a debug lightmap
    F2 Increase the lightmap resolution
    F3 Decrease the lightmap resolution
    F4 Toggles shadows. This can improve performance

Building requires a working POSIX build system and:

    glm
    glew
    glfw3

Then:

    $ make && ./postpile

On mac you need the XCode and the command line utilities. Apple doesn't make
this too easy because they want you to use their IDE with the associated
platform lockin. Start by installing xcode from the app store, then to get
the command line utilities, (it changes over time, but for now), visit:

    https://developer.apple.com/download/more/

and search for "command line". Install the appropriate version.

The dependencies can be installed with homebrew (http://brew.sh) like:

    $ brew install glm glew glfw

On Debian (probably similar on Ubuntu) GNU/Linux, use:

    $ sudo apt install build-essential libglm-dev libglew-dev libglfw3-dev
