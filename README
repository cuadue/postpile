A doodle inspired by RPGs and hexagonal games. The controls are:

                  forward

                     W
    forward-left  Q     E  forward-right
       back-left  A     D  back-right
                     S

                  backward

    F zooms in
    V zooms out
    T pitches up
    G pitches down

    F1 Toggles a debug lightmap
    F2 Increase the lightmap resolution
    F3 Decrease the lightmap resolution

Building requires a working POSIX build system and:

    glm
    SDL2
    SDL2_image
    glew
    glfw3

Then:

    make && ./postpile
