A doodle for learning OpenGL, GLSL, model loading, and the like.

The controls are:

                  forward

                     W
    forward-left  Q     E  forward-right
       back-left  A     D  back-right
                     S

                  backward

    F       zooms in
    V       zooms out
    T       pitches up
    G       pitches down
    Space   passes time

    F1 Toggles a debug lightmap
    F2 Increase the lightmap resolution
    F3 Decrease the lightmap resolution
    F4 Toggles shadows. This can improve performance

Building requires a working POSIX build system and:

    glm
    glew
    glfw3

Then:

    $ make && ./postpile

On Mac you need the XCode and the command line utilities. The dependencies can
be installed with homebrew <http://brew.sh> like:

    $ brew install glm glew glfw

On Debian (probably similar on Ubuntu) GNU/Linux, use:

    $ sudo apt install build-essential libglm-dev libglew-dev libglfw3-dev
