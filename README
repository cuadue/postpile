A doodle inspired by RPGs and hexagonal games. The controls are:

       W         forward
    Q     E      forward-left and forward-right
    A     D      back-left and back-right
       S         backward

There's no point to any of it (much the same as in any artform) although I make
no claim to artistry.

Building requires a bunch of junk, such as: `glm`, `SDL2`, `SDL_image`,
`OpenGL`, and maybe most importantly, a working POSIX build system.

There are efforts to try to make a distributable OSX package, but since I
avoid transient fads, I presume you can run one command:
`make && ./postpile`.
